    "There are n couples: $(𝐻_1,𝑊_1)$, $(𝐻_2,𝑊_2)$, …, $(𝐻_𝑛,𝑊_𝑛)$  where $𝐻_𝑖$ is husband $𝑖$ and $𝑊_𝑖$ is wife $𝑖$.\n",

    "They need to cross from the left bank of a river to the right bank.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a boat that can carry at most two people at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Important: There is an island midway between the left and right banks. The boat can stop at the island.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Jealousy constraint: No wife may ever be in the presence of another husband (on any shore or the island or in the boat) unless her own husband is also present. Otherwise, fights (and failures) occur.\n",

    "1. Put the problem in a form of a search tree: root, nodes, solution and rules for constructing the childrens.\n",
